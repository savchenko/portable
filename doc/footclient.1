.SH NAME
footclient - start new terminals in a foot server
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfootclient\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.br
\fBfootclient\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] <\fIcommand\fR> [\fICOMMAND OPTIONS\fR]
.P
All trailing (non-option) arguments are treated as a command, and its
arguments, to execute (instead of the default shell).\&
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBfootclient\fR is used together with \fBfoot\fR(1) in \fB--server\fR
mode.\&
.P
Running it without arguments will open a new terminal window (hosted
in the foot server), with your default shell.\& The exit code will be
that of the terminal.\& I.\&e \fBfootclient\fR does not exit until the
terminal has terminated.\&

Override an option set in the configuration file.\& If \fISECTION\fR is not
given, defaults to \fImain\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-d\fR,\fB--log-level\fR={\fBinfo\fR,\fBwarning\fR,\fBerror\fR,\fBnone\fR}
.RS 4
Log level, used both for log output on stderr as well as
syslog.\& Default: \fIinfo\fR.\&

.P
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
.P
Footlient will exit with code 220 if there is a failure in footclient
itself (for example, the server socket does not exist).\&
.P
If \fB-N\fR,\fB--no-wait\fR is used, footclient exits with code 0 as soon as
the foot server has been instructed to open a new window.\&
.P
If not, footclient may also exit with code 230.\& This indicates a
failure in the foot server.\&
.P
In all other cases the exit code is that of the client application
(i.\&e.\& the shell).\&
.P
.SH TERMINFO
.P
Client applications use the terminfo identifier specified by the
environment variable \fBTERM\fR (set by foot) to determine terminal
capabilities.\&
.P
Foot has two terminfo definitions: \fBfoot\fR and \fBfoot-direct\fR, with
\fBfoot\fR being the default.\&
.P
The difference between the two is in the number of colors they
describe; \fBfoot\fR describes 256 colors and \fBfoot-direct\fR 16.\&7 million
colors (24-bit truecolor).\&
.P
Note that using the \fBfoot\fR terminfo does not limit the number of
usable colors to 256; applications can still use 24-bit RGB colors.\& In
fact, most applications work best with \fBfoot\fR (including 24-bit
colors)).\& Using \fB*-direct\fR terminfo entries has been known to crash
some ncurses applications even.\&
.P
There are however applications that need a \fB*-direct\fR terminfo entry
for 24-bit support.\& Emacs is one such example.\&
.P
While using either \fBfoot\fR or \fBfoot-direct\fR is strongly recommended, it
is possible to use e.\&g.\& \fBxterm-256color\fR as well.\& This can be useful
when remoting to a system where foot's terminfo entries cannot easily
be installed.\&
.P
Note that terminfo entries can be installed in the user's home
directory.\& I.\&e.\& if you do not have root access, or if there is no
distro package for foot's terminfo entries, you can install foot's
terminfo entries manually, by copying \fBfoot\fR and \fBfoot-direct\fR to
\fB~/.\&terminfo/f/\fR.\&
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.P
The following environment variables are used by footclient:
.P
\fBXDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fR
.RS 4
Used to construct the default \fIPATH\fR for the \fB--server-socket\fR
option, when no explicit argument is given (see above).\&
.P
.RE
\fBWAYLAND_DISPLAY\fR
.RS 4
Used to construct the default \fIPATH\fR for the \fB--server-socket\fR
option, when no explicit argument is given (see above).\&
.P
.RE
The following environment variables are set in the child process:
.P
\fBTERM\fR
.RS 4
terminfo/termcap identifier.\& This is used by client applications
to determine which capabilities a terminal supports.\& The value is
set according to either the \fB--term\fR command-line option or the
\fBterm\fR config option in \fBfoot.\&ini\fR(5).\&
.P
.RE
\fBCOLORTERM\fR
.RS 4
This variable is set to \fBtruecolor\fR, to indicate to client
applications that 24-bit RGB colors are supported.\&
