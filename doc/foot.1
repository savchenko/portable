.SH NAME
foot - Wayland terminal emulator
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfoot\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.br
\fBfoot\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] <\fIcommand\fR> [\fICOMMAND OPTIONS\fR]
.P
All trailing (non-option) arguments are treated as a command, and its
arguments, to execute (instead of the default shell).\&
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBfoot\fR is a Wayland terminal emulator.\& Running it without arguments
will start a new terminal window with your default shell.\&
.P
You can override the default shell by appending a custom command to
the foot command line
.P
.RS 4
\fBfoot sh -c "echo hello world && sleep 5"\fR
.P
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB-c\fR,\fB--config\fR=\fIPATH\fR
.RS 4
Path to configuration file.\& Default:
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/foot/foot.\&ini\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-C\fR,\fB--check-config\fR
.RS 4
Verify configuration and then exit with 0 if ok, otherwise exit
with 230 (see \fBEXIT STATUS\fR).\&
.P
.RE
\fB-o\fR,\fB--override\fR=[\fISECTION\fR.\&]\fIKEY\fR=\fIVALUE\fR
.RS 4
Override an option set in the configuration file.\& If \fISECTION\fR is not
given, defaults to \fImain\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-f\fR,\fB--font\fR=\fIFONT\fR
.RS 4
Comma separated list of fonts to use, in fontconfig format (see
\fBFONT FORMAT\fR).\&
.P
The first font is the primary font.\& The remaining fonts are
fallback fonts that will be used whenever a glyph cannot be found
in the primary font.\&
.P
The fallback fonts are searched in the order they appear.\& If a
glyph cannot be found in any of the fallback fonts, the dynamic
fallback list from fontconfig (for the primary font) is
searched.\&
.P
Default: \fImonospace\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-w\fR,\fB--window-size-pixels\fR=\fIWIDTHxHEIGHT\fR
.RS 4
Set initial window width and height, in pixels.\& Default: \fI700x500\fR.\&

.P
.RE
\fB-t\fR,\fB--term\fR=\fITERM\fR
.RS 4

and \fBENVIRONMENT\fR).\& Default: \fIfoot\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-T\fR,\fB--title\fR=\fITITLE\fR

.P
.RE
\fB-a\fR,\fB--app-id\fR=\fIID\fR
.RS 4
Value to set the \fBapp-id\fR property on the Wayland window
to.\& Default: \fIfoot\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-m\fR,\fB--maximized\fR
.RS 4
Start in maximized mode.\& If both \fB--maximized\fR and \fB--fullscreen\fR
are specified, the \fIlast\fR one takes precedence.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-F\fR,\fB--fullscreen\fR
.RS 4
Start in fullscreen mode.\& If both \fB--maximized\fR and \fB--fullscreen\fR
are specified, the \fIlast\fR one takes precedence.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-L\fR,\fB--login-shell\fR
.RS 4
Start a login shell, by prepending a '-' to argv[0].\&
.P
.RE
\fB-D\fR,\fB--working-directory\fR=\fIDIR\fR
.RS 4
Initial working directory for the client application.\& Default:
\fICWD of foot\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-s\fR,\fB--server\fR[=\fIPATH\fR]
.RS 4
Run as a server.\& In this mode, a single foot instance hosts
multiple terminals (windows).\& Use \fBfootclient\fR(1) to launch new
terminals.\&
.P
This saves some memory since for example fonts and glyph caches
can be shared between the terminals.\&
.P
It also saves upstart time since the config has already been
loaded and parsed, and most importantly, fonts have already been
loaded (and their glyph caches are likely to already have been
populated).\&
.P
Each terminal will have its own rendering threads, but all Wayland
communication, as well as input/output to the shell, is
multiplexed in the main thread.\& Thus, this mode might result in
slightly worse performance when multiple terminals are under heavy
load.\&
.P
Also be aware that should one terminal crash, it will take all the
others with it.\&
.P
The default path is
\fB$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/foot-$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.\&sock\fR.\&
.P
If \fB$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fR is not set, the default path is instead
\fB/tmp/foot.\&sock\fR.\&
.P
If \fB$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fR is set, but \fB$WAYLAND_DISPLAY\fR is not,
the default path is \fB$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/foot.\&sock\fR.\&
.P
Note that if you change the default, you will also need to use the
\fB--server-socket\fR option in \fBfootclient\fR(1) and point it to your
custom socket path.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-H\fR,\fB--hold\fR
.RS 4
Remain open after child process exits.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-p\fR,\fB--print-pid\fR=\fIFILE\fR|\fIFD\fR
.RS 4
Print PID to this file, or FD, when successfully started.\& The file
(or FD) is closed immediately after writing the PID.\& When a \fIFILE\fR
as been specified, the file is unlinked at exit.\&
.P
This option can only be used in combination with \fB-s\fR,\fB--server\fR.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-d\fR,\fB--log-level\fR={\fBinfo\fR,\fBwarning\fR,\fBerror\fR,\fBnone\fR}

.RE
.P
.SH URLs
.P
Foot supports URL detection.\& But, unlike many other terminal
emulators, where URLs are highlighted when they are hovered and opened
by clicking on them, foot uses a keyboard driven approach.\&
.P
Pressing \fBctrl\fR+\fBshift\fR+\fBu\fR enters \fI“URL mode”\fR, where all currently
visible URLs are underlined, and is associated with a
\fI“jump-label”\fR.\& The jump-label indicates the \fIkey sequence\fR
(e.\&g.\& \fB”AF”\fR) to use to activate the URL.\&
.P
The key binding can, of course, be customized, like all other key
bindings in foot.\& See \fBshow-urls-launch\fR and \fBshow-urls-copy\fR in
\fBfoot.\&ini\fR(5).\&
.P
\fBshow-urls-launch\fR by default opens the URL with \fBxdg-open\fR.\& This can
be changed with the \fBurl-launch\fR option.\&
.P
\fBshow-urls-copy\fR is an alternative to \fBshow-urls-launch\fR, that changes
what activating an URL \fIdoes\fR; instead of opening it, it copies it to
the clipboard.\& It is unbound by default.\&
.P
Jump label colors, the URL underline color, and the letters used in
the jump label key sequences can be configured.\&
.P
.SH ALT/META CHARACTERS
.P
By default, foot prefixes meta characters with \fBESC\fR.\& This corresponds
to XTerm's \fBmetaSendsEscape\fR option set to \fBtrue\fR.\&
.P
This can be disabled programmatically with \fBE[?\&1036l\fR (and enabled
again with \fBE[?\&1036h\fR).\&
.P
When disabled, foot will instead set the 8:th bit of meta character
and then UTF-8 encode it.\& This corresponds to XTerm's \fBeightBitMeta\fR
option set to \fBtrue\fR.\&
.P
This can also be disabled programmatically with \fBrmm\fR (Reset Meta Mode,
\fBE[?\&1034l\fR), and enabled again with \fBsmm\fR (Set Meta Mode,
\fBE[?\&1034h\fR).\&
.P
.SH BACKSPACE
.P
Foot transmits DEL (\fB^?\&\fR) on backspace.\& This corresponds to XTerm's
\fBbackarrowKey\fR option set to \fBfalse\fR, and to DECBKM being \fIreset\fR.\&
.P
To instead transmit BS (\fB^H\fR), press \fBctrl\fR+\fBbackspace\fR.\&
.P
Note that foot does \fBnot\fR implement DECBKM, and that the behavior
described above \fBcannot\fR be changed.\&
.P
Finally, pressing \fBalt\fR will prefix the transmitted byte with ESC.\&
.P
.SH KEYPAD
.P
By default, \fBNum Lock\fR overrides the run-time configuration keypad
mode; when active, the keypad is always considered to be in
\fInumerical\fR mode.\& This corresponds to XTerm's \fBnumLock\fR option set to
\fBtrue\fR.\&
.P
In this mode, the keypad keys always sends either numbers (Num Lock is
active) or cursor movement keys (up, down, left, right, page up, page
down etc).\&
.P
This can be disabled programmatically with \fBE[?\&1035l\fR (and enabled
again with \fBE[?\&1035h\fR).\&
.P
When disabled, the keypad sends custom escape sequences instead of
numbers, when in \fIapplication\fR mode.\&
.P
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
See \fBfoot.\&ini\fR(5)
.P
.SH TERMINFO
.P
Client applications use the terminfo identifier specified by the
environment variable \fBTERM\fR (set by foot) to determine terminal
capabilities.\&
.P
Foot has two terminfo definitions: \fBfoot\fR and \fBfoot-direct\fR, with
\fBfoot\fR being the default.\&
.P
The difference between the two is in the number of colors they
describe; \fBfoot\fR describes 256 colors and \fBfoot-direct\fR 16.\&7 million
colors (24-bit truecolor).\&
.P
Note that using the \fBfoot\fR terminfo does not limit the number of
usable colors to 256; applications can still use 24-bit RGB colors.\& In
fact, most applications work best with \fBfoot\fR (including 24-bit
colors)).\& Using \fB*-direct\fR terminfo entries has been known to crash
some ncurses applications even.\&
.P
There are however applications that need a \fB*-direct\fR terminfo entry
for 24-bit support.\& Emacs is one such example.\&
.P
While using either \fBfoot\fR or \fBfoot-direct\fR is strongly recommended, it
is possible to use e.\&g.\& \fBxterm-256color\fR as well.\& This can be useful
when remoting to a system where foot's terminfo entries cannot easily
be installed.\&
.P
Note that terminfo entries can be installed in the user's home
directory.\& I.\&e.\& if you do not have root access, or if there is no
distro package for foot's terminfo entries, you can install foot's
terminfo entries manually, by copying \fBfoot\fR and \fBfoot-direct\fR to
\fB~/.\&terminfo/f/\fR.\&
.P
